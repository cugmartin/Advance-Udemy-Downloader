Utility script to download Udemy courses, has support for DRM videos but requires the user to acquire the decryption key (for legal reasons).<br>
Windows is the primary development OS, but I've made an effort to support Linux also (Mac untested).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool will not work on encrypted courses without decryption keys being provided!
>
> Downloading courses is against Udemy's Terms of Service, I am NOT held responsible for your account getting suspended as a result from the use of this program!
>
> This program is WIP, the code is provided as-is and I am not held resposible for any legal issues resulting from the use of this program.

### Requirements

The following third-party tools are required to run the script. They are **not included in this repository** and must be downloaded and installed manually, ensuring they are accessible in your system's PATH.

-   [Python 3](https://python.org/)
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - This tool is also available in Linux package repositories.
    -   NOTE: It is recommended to use a custom build from the yt-dlp team that contains various patches for issues when used alongside yt-dlp, however it is not required. Latest builds can be found [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest)
-   [aria2/aria2c](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/) - This tool is also available in Linux package repositories
-   [shaka-packager](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager/releases/latest)
-   [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/) - This tool is also available in Linux package repositories, but can also be installed using pip if desired (`pip install yt-dlp`)

### Quick Start

To download DRM-protected courses, you'll need to extract cookies and Widevine decryption keys. Follow these steps:

1)  **Extract Cookies (for Udemy Login)**:
    *   Install a "Cookies Editor" extension for your browser. Mozilla Firefox is recommended for better compatibility with Widevine L3 Decrypter.
        *   **Google Chrome**: [Cookies Editor](https://cookie-editor.com/)
        *   **Mozilla Firefox**: [Cookies Editor](https://cookie-editor.com/)
    *   Log in to your Udemy account in your browser.
    *   Open the installed "Cookies Editor" extension.
    *   Copy the cookies in "Netscape" format.
    *   Paste the copied content into the `cookie.txt` file located in the project directory.

2)  **Extract Widevine DRM Keys (for Encrypted Videos)**:
    *   **Important**: As of now, the "Widevine L3 Decrypter" extension is not fully supported on Google Chrome for key extraction. It is highly recommended to use **Mozilla Firefox** for this step.
    *   Install the "Widevine L3 Decrypter" extension on Mozilla Firefox:
        *   **Mozilla Firefox**: [Widevine L3 Decrypter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/widevine-l3-decrypter/)
    *   If you copied cookies from Google Chrome in the previous step, ensure you are logged into your Udemy account on Mozilla Firefox.
    *   Navigate to the Udemy course you wish to download and start playing any video lecture.
    *   While the video is playing, open the "Widevine L3 Decrypter" extension.
    *   With default settings, click the "Guess" button. Wait for the extension to process and display the decryption keys.
    *   Copy the "Key" and "Key ID" provided by the extension.
    *   Paste these keys into the `keyfile.json` file in the project directory. This will allow the script to decrypt the encrypted files downloaded from Udemy and bypass DRM protection.

3)  **Install dependencies** (Python 3.9+ recommended):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Web Console (FastAPI)

Start the Web console:

```bash
python -m uvicorn webapp.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

If you want auto-reload during development, make sure reload only watches the `webapp` folder (otherwise changes in `out_dir/` during downloads may trigger reload and interrupt running tasks):

```bash
python -m uvicorn webapp.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload --reload-dir webapp
```

2)  **Run the automation script**:
    Use the `main.py` script with command-line arguments to specify the target URL and desired actions.

    **Example Usage:**
    -   Passing a Bearer Token and Course ID as an argument
    -   `python main.py -c <Course URL> -b <Bearer Token>`
    -   `python main.py -c https://www.udemy.com/courses/myawesomecourse -b <Bearer Token>`
-   Download a specific quality
    -   `python main.py -c <Course URL> -q 720`
-   Download assets along with lectures
    -   `python main.py -c <Course URL> --download-assets`
-   Download assets and specify a quality
    -   `python main.py -c <Course URL> -q 360 --download-assets`
-   Download captions (Defaults to English)
    -   `python main.py -c <Course URL> --download-captions`
