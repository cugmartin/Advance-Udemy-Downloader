Hi! I'm Alex and I am pleased to meet you!

I have a master's degree in **Internet Technologies** and I'm an **active senior web and Cloud developer**. In the last years I worked designing and implementing user interfacesand cloud solutions for various clients ranging from automotive to e-commerce.

I firmly believe that knowing is never enough. Knowledge must be put to **practice**, that is why I want to focus my teaching on concrete, **real world programs**.
