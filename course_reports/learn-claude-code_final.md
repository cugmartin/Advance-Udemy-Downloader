## Description
**_IMPORTANT! An active Claude subscription is required to take this course. Unfortunately Claude Code is not a free tool._**

Step into the future of software development with **Claude Code**. In this hands-on, project-based course, you'll learn how to harness agentic coding to build full-stack applications faster, smarter, and more consistently than ever before.

We'll build a complete **workout logging app** called **LiftingDiary**, powered by **Next.js**, while letting Claude Code generate the heavy lifting for us. Along the way, you'll discover how to design and generate your own coding standards, workflows, and automations so that Claude Code writes production-ready code that feels like _your code_.

What You'll Learn:

- **Agentic Coding Fundamentals**

Understand how Claude Code works, how to steer its output, and build your own "agentic workflows."

- **Building LiftingDiary from Scratch**

Use Claude Code to generate an entire Next.js app, from setup to deployment.

- **Database & Auth Integration**

  - Seed a **Postgres database** (hosted on Neon) with sample data in seconds using **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

  - Implement secure authentication with **Clerk**.

  - Manage schema and queries using **Drizzle ORM**.
- **UI & Developer Experience**

  - Build a modern interface with **shadcn/ui**.

  - Customize components and maintain design consistency.
- **Claude Code as Your Teammate**

  - Write custom **documentation files** to guide coding standards.

  - Enforce conventions with **rules** to influence every line of output.

  - Create **custom slash commands** for common tasks.

  - Automate repetitive workflows.
- **Best Practices with Claude Code**

Discover how to avoid pitfalls, keep your codebase maintainable, and treat Claude as an intelligent pair-programmer instead of a copy-paste machine.

- **Advanced Agentic Coding Techniques**

Learn how to prompt, build workflows, and extend Claude Code with your own conventions.


Whether you're a beginner curious about AI coding tools or an experienced developer ready to go pro with Claude Code, this course will give you the skills, confidence, and systemized approach to thrive in the new era of software development.
