The course helped me clearly see how Generative AI can transform customer support. The real-life integration examples were very practical, and after the hands-on tasks I realized how much routine work AI can take over, leaving more space for genuine conversations with clients. Our team now responds faster, customer satisfaction has improved, and I’ve come to view AI not as a replacement for people, but as a powerful tool that empowers us. Highly recommend this course!
